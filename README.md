# Weather API using Redis cache

A simple **Node.js API** that fetches real-time weather data from a **3rd-party API (Visual Crossing)** and uses **Redis** for caching to improve performance and reduce redundant API calls.

This project demonstrates:
- Working with 3rd-party APIs
- Using Redis as an in-memory cache
- Managing environment variables
- Implementing error handling and rate limiting

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-api.git
cd weather-api
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
PORT = 3000
WEATHER_API_KEY = your_api_key
WEATHER_API_URL = https://weather.visualcrossing.com/VisualCrossingWebServices/rest/services/timeline
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

4. Run the server:

```bash
